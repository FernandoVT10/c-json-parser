# C Json Parser
> [!WARNING]
> This library is not production ready, it was created to learn about parsers.

This is a little library that parses json into useful `C` structs. There are a lot of helper functions missing, that is because this project was meant to be a learning project for me. A project to learn how to work with `Lexers` and `Parsers`.

This project also has a really good (at least in my opinion) error system.

## Run
You need to have `gcc` installed and the run:
```console
$ ./build.sh
$ ./main
```

> [!NOTE]
> Inside the `main` function in `src/main.c` you can edit the file path of the json file that is going to be parsed.
