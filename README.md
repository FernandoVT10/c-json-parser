# C Json Parser
> [!WARNING]
> This library is not production ready, it was created to learn about parsers.

This is a little library that parses json into useful `C` structs. There are a lot of helper functions missing, that is because this project was meant to be a learning project for me. A project to learn how to work with `Lexers` and `Parsers`.
